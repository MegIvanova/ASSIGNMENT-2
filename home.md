My Hbbies . . . 

I enjoy gaining insights into the psychologies of other cultures and times. I love computer programs and I love learning how to use them. Right now I'm trying to tackle Github. I'm also into reading, writing and blogging. Occasionally I like to write short fiction stories, usually about mystical, mythological creatures and old but sacred objects that are described in ancient legends. When I am not in front of the computer I love to work out (great stress relief), cook for my husband and me or play with my bearded dragon and abnormally strange cat.
